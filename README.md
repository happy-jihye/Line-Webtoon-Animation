# Line Webtoon Talking Head Project

Finally, the Line Webtoon Year-in-review has opened ! ðŸŽ‰

On this page below, you can see how much you love the Line Webtoon this year by personalized statistics; your favorite genres, number of episodes you read, series you started to read this year, the time you spent on webtoon, and more. And characters from the webtoon will dynamically present the result to you.

I participated as an AI researcher for animation production in this project. For generating videos with low capacity, high quality, and various motions, I pre-processed webtoon datasets and investigated the talking head model for five months. After preparation, I created animations through the following procedures.

1. **Data Preparation**
    - Our team built Line Webtoon Datasets. The dataset contained images of a total of 73 works and 165 characters.
    - I pre-processed the Line Webtoon Datasets to train the model efficiently.
2. **Research AI model**
    - I struggled to develop a talking-head model that could generate natural videos in the case of webtoon characters such as Lore Olympus with severe dÃ©formÃ©. Using Stylegan based generating model and a warping-based talking head model, I developed the AI model generating webtoon videos with high quality and various motions. Although we could make a more dynamic motion, we limited the videos to have a small capacity and neat design.
3. **Post-Processing**
    - Our team conducted post-processing to make good-quality videos.


## Example of the result.

We produced animations for 76 works. The following results are some of the samples.

Unfortunately, the development team will not disclose the detailed process due to security issues. Line Webtoon Company is doing various research using AI, so please show a lot of interest!
